# Running Collapse OS on real hardware

Collapse OS is designed to run on ad-hoc post-collapse hardware
build from scavenged parts. These machines don't exist yet.

To make Collapse OS as likely as possible to be useful in a
post-collapse world, we try to give as many examples as possible
of deployment on hacked-up hardware.

For example, we include a recipe for running a Sega Master
System with a PS/2 keyboard plugged to a hacked up controller
cord with an AVR MCU interfacing between the PS/2 connector and
the controller port.

This setup, for which drivers are included in Collapse OS, exist
in only one copy, the copy the author of the recipe made.

However, the idea is that this recipe, which contains schematics
and precise instructions, could help a post-collapse engineer
to hack her way around and achieve something similar. She would
then have a good example of schematics and drivers that are
known to work.

If you want to run Collape OS on real hardware, take a look at
arch-specific documentation in /recipes and see if some of the
supported hardware is close to something you have.

Easy pickings are PC/AT (which run on modern PCs supporting
legacy BIOS), Sega Genesis w/ Everdrive and TI-84+. Those
options don't require any soldering.
