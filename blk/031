Glossary

Stack notation: "<stack before> -- <stack after>". Rightmost is
top of stack (TOS). For example, in "a b -- c d", b is TOS
before, d is TOS after. "R:" means that the Return Stack is
modified. "I:" prefix means "IMMEDIATE", that is, that this
stack transformation is made at compile time.

Word references (wordref): When we say we have a "word
reference", it's a pointer to a words *code link*. For example,
the label "PLUS:" in this unit is a word reference. Why not
refer to the beginning of the word struct? Because we actually
seldom refer to the name and prev link, except during
compilation, so defining "word reference" this way makes the
code easier to understand.
