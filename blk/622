VDP Driver

Implement (emit) on the console. Characters start at the top
left. Every (emit) call converts the ASCII char received to its
internal font, then put that char on screen, advancing the
cursor by one. When reaching the end of the line (33rd char),
wrap to the next.

In the future, there's going to be a scrolling mechanism when
we reach the bottom of the screen, but for now, when the end of
the screen is reached, we wrap up to the top.

When reaching a new line, we clear that line and the next to
help readability.

Load range: 623-623
