2. If it references a word from this unit or from native
   definitions, these need to be properly offsetted because
   their offset at compile time are not the same as their
   runtime offsets.
3. Anything they refer to in the boot binary has to be properly
   stabilized.
4. Make sure that the words you compile are not overridden by
   the full interpreter.
5. When using words as immediates, make sure that they're not
   defined in icore or, if they are, make sure that they are
   *not* offsetted
