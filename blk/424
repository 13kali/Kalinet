( Hello, hello, krkrkrkr... do you hear me?
  Ah, voice at last! Some lines above need comments
  BTW: Forth lines limited to 64 cols because of default
  input buffer size in Collapse OS

  40 is ASCII for '('. We do this to simplify XPACK's task of
  not mistakenly consider '(' definition as a comment.
  LIT<: 34 == litWord
  LITA: 36 == addrWord
  COMPILE: Tough one. Get addr of caller word (example above
  (br)) and then call LITA on it. )
