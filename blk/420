Bootstrap guide

You want to deploy Collapse OS on a new system? Start here.

What is Collapse OS? It is a binary placed either in ROM on
in RAM by a bootloader. That binary, when executed, initializes
itself to a Forth interpreter. In most cases, that Forth
interpreter will have some access to a mass storage device,
which allows it to access Collapse OS' disk blocks and come
to this block to bootstrap itself some more.

This binary can be separated in 5 distinct layers:
1. Boot code (B280)
2. Boot words (B305)
3. Core words (low) (B350)
4. Drivers                                              (cont.)
