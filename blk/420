Core words

These words follow Inner core words, but unlike them, these are
self-bootstrapping and don't depend on the Cross Compiler. They
will typically be included in source form right after a stage1
binary which will interpret it on boot and bootstrap itself to
a full intepreter, which can then be relinked with the
Relinker. There is no loader for these libraries because you
will typically XPACK (B267) them.
