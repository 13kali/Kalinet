( RLWORD pre-comment

  Relink a word with specified offset. If it's not of the type
  "compiled word", ignore. If it is, advance in word until a2
  is met, and for each word that is above ol, reduce that
  reference by o.
  Arguments: a1: wordref a2: word end addr o: offset to apply
             ol: offset limit. don't apply on refs under it.

  The 0x0e and 0x2b check at the beginning is to ensure we have
  either a compiledWord or a doesWord. If we don't, we do
  nothing. The further 0x2b check is because if we have a
  doesWord, we start 2 bytes later.
