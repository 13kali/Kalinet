0x22: litWord. Similar to a number word, except that instead of
being followed by a 2 byte number, it is followed by a
null-terminated string. Upon execution, the address of that
null-terminated string is pushed on the PSP and IP is advanced
to the address following the null.

Also note that word routines references in wordrefs are 1b.
This means that all word routine reference must live below
0x100 in boot binary. This is why numberWord and addrWord are
squeezed where they are.
