(cont.) You open a chain with "<>{" and you close a chain with
"<>}".  Then, in between those words, you can chain operators.
For example, to check whether A == B or A == C, you would
write:

A <>{ B &= C |= <>}

The first operator must be of the "&" type because the chain
starts with its flag to true. For example, "<>{ <>}" yields
true.

To check whether A is in between B and C inclusively, you would
write:

A <>{ B 1 - &> C 1 + &< <>}
