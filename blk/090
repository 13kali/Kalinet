On a bare system (only boot+icore), this sequence will result
in (c<) reading characters from memory starting from CURRENT
(this is why we put CURRENT in BOOT C< PTR, it tracks current
pos ).

This means that you can put initialization code in source form
right into your binary, right after your last compiled dict
entry and it's going to be executed as such until you set a new
(c<).

Note that there is no EMIT in a bare system. You have to take
care of supplying one before your load core.fs and its higher
levels.
