(cont.) On a bare system (only boot+icore), this sequence will
result in "(parse)" reading only decimals and (c<) reading
characters from memory starting from CURRENT (this is why we
put CURRENT in SYSTEM SCRATCHPAD, it tracks current pos ).

This means that you can put initialization code in source form
right into your binary, right after your last compiled dict
entry and it's going to be executed as such until you set a new
(c<).

Note that there is no EMIT in a bare system. You have to take
care of supplying one before your load core.fs and its higher
levels.
