PC ORG @ 4 + ! ( find )
( Find the entry corresponding to word name where (HL) points
  to in dictionary having its tip at DE and sets DE to point
  to that entry. Z if found, NZ if not. )
    BC PUSHqq,
    HL PUSHqq,
	( First, figure out string len )
    A (HL) LDrr, A ORr,
	( special case. zero len? we never find anything. )
    IFNZ, ( fail-B296 )
( Let's do something weird: We'll hold HL by the *tail*.
  Because of our dict structure and because we know our
  lengths, it's easier to compare starting from the end. )
    C A LDrr, B 0 LDrn, ( C holds our length )
    BC ADDHLss, HL INCss, ( HL points to after-last-char )
                                                     ( cont . )
