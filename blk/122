'H' goes to the beginning of the line, 'L' to the end.

'w' moves forward by a word. 'b' moves backward by a word.
'W' moves to end-of-word. 'B' moves backward to end-of-word.

'I', 'F' and 'E' invoke the corresponding command from the
Block Editor (B100). Refer to documentation there.

'f' puts the contents of your previous cursor movement into the
find buffer. If that movement was a forward movement, it brings
the cursor back where it was. This allows for an efficient
combination of movements and 'E'. For example, if you want to
delete the next word, you type 'w', then 'f', then check your
"F" buffer to be sure, then press 'E'.

'X' deletes "modifier" characters following cursor.     (cont.)
