Collapse OS

This is the first block of Collapse OS' filesystem which cons-
ists of contiguous blocks of 1024 bytes organized in 16 lines
of 64 characters. You can display a block's content with the
"LIST" command. For example, "123 LIST" shows the contents of
the block 123. If a block contains source code, you can inter-
pret it with "LOAD".

Conventions: When you see "(cont.)" at the bottom right of a
block, it means that the next block continues the same kind of
contents. Block numbers are abbreviated with prefix "B". "BX"
means "block X".

The master index of this filesystem is at B1. The Block editor
at B100 is a convenient way to navigate blocks.
