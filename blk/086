0x2b: doesWord. This word is created by "DOES>" and is followed
by a 2-byte value as well as the address where "DOES>" was
compiled. At that address is an atom list exactly like in a
compiled word. Upon execution, after having pushed its cell
addr to PSP, it execute its reference exactly like a
compiledWord.

0x20: numberWord. No word is actually compiled with this
routine, but atoms are.  Atoms with a reference to the number
words routine are followed, *in the atom list*, of a 2-byte
number. Upon execution, that number is fetched and IP is
avdanced by an extra 2 bytes.

0x24: addrWord. Exactly like a numberWord, except that it is
treated differently by meta-tools.                      (cont.)
