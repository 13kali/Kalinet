0x2b: doesWord. This word is created by "DOES>" and is followed
by a 2-byte value as well as the address where "DOES>" was
compiled. At that address is an atom list exactly like in a
compiled word. Upon execution, after having pushed its cell
addr to PSP, it execute its reference exactly like a
compiledWord.

Also note that word routines references in wordrefs are 1b.
This means that all word routine reference must live below
0x100 in boot binary. This is why numberWord and addrWord are
squeezed where they are.
