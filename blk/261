Words overrides like ":", "IMMEDIATE" and "CODE" are not
automatically shadowed to allow the harmless inclusion of
this unit. This shadowing has to take place in your xcomp
configuration.                      

See example in /emul/xcomp.fs

Why limit ourselves to icore? Oh, I've tried cross-compiling
the whole shebang. I tried. And failed. Too dynamic.
