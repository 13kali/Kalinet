PC ORG @ 0x22 + ! ( litWord, 0xf7, tight on the 0x100 limit )
( Like numberWord, but instead of being followed by a 2 bytes
  number, it's followed by a null-terminated string. When
  called, puts the string's address on PS )
    IY PUSHqq, HL POPqq, ( <-- IP )
    HL PUSHqq,
    ( skip to null char )
    A XORr, ( look for null )
    B A LDrr,
    C A LDrr,
    CPIR,
	( CPIR advances HL regardless of comparison, so goes one
      char after NULL. This is good, because that's what we
      want... )
