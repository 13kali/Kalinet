(cont.) The code pointer point to "word routines". These
routines expect to be called with IY pointing to the PF. They
themselves are expected to end by jumping to the address at
(IP). They will usually do so with "jp next". They are 1b
because all those routines live in the first 0x100 bytes of
the boot binary. The 0 MSB is assumed.

That's for "regular" words (words that are part of the dict
chain). There are also "special words", for example NUMBER,
LIT, FBR, that have a slightly different structure. They're
also a pointer to an executable, but as for the other fields,
the only one they have is the "flags" field.
