Cells: It's not possible to know for sure whether a cellWord
contains an address or a number. They are therefore not
automatically relinked. You have to manually relink each of
them with RLCELL. In the case of a DOES> word, PFA+2, which
is always an offset, is automatically relinked, but not
PFA+0.

Load with "122 LOAD"
