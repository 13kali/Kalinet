Block explorer

This is an application to conveniently browse the contents of
the disk blocks. You can launch it with "102 LOAD".

USAGE: When loaded, the Forth interpreter is replaced by the
explorer interpreter. Typing "Q" quits the program.

Typing a decimal number followed by space or return lists the
contents of that block.
