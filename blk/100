Block editor

This is an application to conveniently browse the contents of
the disk blocks and edit them. You can load it with "105 LOAD".

Browse mode: If you execute BROWSE, the Forth interpreter is
replaced by browser's loop. Typing "Q" quits the browser.

In this mode, typing a decimal number followed by space or
return lists the contents of that block. B for previous block,
N for next.

When not in browse mode, your prompt is a regular Forth prompt
with editor words loaded.
