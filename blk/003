Collapse OS usage guide

This document is not meant to be an introduction to Forth, but
to instruct the user about the peculiarities of this Forth
implementation. The recommended introductory book is Starting
Forth by Leo Brodie. This is the reference that was used to
build this implementation and many of the conventions described
in this book are followed in Collapse OS. Be sure to refer to
the dictionary (B30) for a word reference.
