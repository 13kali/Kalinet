STACK OVERFLOW PROTECTION: To avoid having to check for stack
underflow after each pop operation (which can end up being
prohibitive in terms of costs), we give ourselves a nice 6
bytes buffer. 6 bytes because we seldom have words requiring
more than 3 items from the stack. Then, at each "exit" call we
check for stack underflow.
