Signed-ness

For simplicity purposes, numbers are generally considered
unsigned. For convenience, decimal parsing and formatting
support the "-" prefix, but under the hood, it's all unsigned.

This leads to some oddities. For example, "-1 0 <" is false.
To compare whether something is negative, use the "<0" word
which is the equivalent to "0x7fff >".
