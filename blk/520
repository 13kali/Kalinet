Fonts

Fonts are kept in "source" form in the following blocks and
then compiled to binary bitmasks by the following code. In
source form, fonts are a simple sequence of '.' and 'X'. '.'
means empty, 'X' means filled. Glyphs are entered one after the
other, starting at 0x21 and ending at 0x7e. To be space
efficient in blocks, we align glyphs horizontally in the blocks
to fit as many character as we can. For example, a 5x7 font
would mean that we would have 12x2 glyphs per block.
