Symbols

Throughout words, different symbols are used in different
contexts, but we try to been consistent in their use. Here's
their definitions:

! - Store
@ - Fetch
$ - Initialize
^ - Arguments in their opposite order
< - Input
> - 1. Pointer in a buffer 2. Opposite of "<".
( - Lower boundary
) - Upper boundary
* - Word indirection (pointer to word)
                                                        (cont.)
