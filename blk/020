However, absolute LOAD operations in Collapse OS aren't aware
of disk spanning and will not work properly in your spanned
system.

Although the usage of absolute LOAD calls are minimally used
(relative LOADs are preferred), they are sometimes unavoidable.
When you span Collapse OS over multiple disks, don't forget to
adjust those absolute LOADs.
