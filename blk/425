anatomy. First, we have constants. Some of them are device-
specific, but some of them are always there. RAMSTART is the
address at which the RAM starts on the system. System variables
will go there and HERE will go after it.

RS_ADDR is where RSP starts and PS_ADDR is where PSP starts.
RSP and PSP are designed to be contiguous. RSP goes up and PSP
goes down. If they meet, we know we have a stack overflow.

Then, we load the assembler and cross compilation unit, which
will be needed for the task ahead.

Then, it's a matter of adding layer after layer. For most
system, all those layers except the drivers will be added the
same way. Drivers are a bit tricker and machine specific. I
can't help you there, you'll have to use your wits.     (cont.)
