anatomy. First, we have constants. Some of them are device-
specific, but some of them are always there. SYSVARS is the
address at which the RAM starts on the system. System variables
will go there and use 0x80 bytes. See B80.

HERESTART determines where... HERE is at startup. 0 means
"same as CURRENT".

RS_ADDR is where RSP starts and PS_ADDR is where PSP starts.
RSP and PSP are designed to be contiguous. RSP goes up and PSP
goes down. If they meet, we know we have a stack overflow.

Then, we load the assembler and cross compilation unit, which
will be needed for the task ahead.
