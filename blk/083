C<?* is a pointer to a word being called by C<?. If 0 or 1,
will return that value as-is.

WORDBUF is the buffer used by WORD

BOOT C< PTR is used when Forth boots from in-memory
source. See "Initialization sequence" below.

INTJUMP All RST offsets (well, not *all* at this moment, I
still have to free those slots...) in boot binaries are made to
jump to this address. If you use one of those slots for an
interrupt, write a jump to the appropriate offset in that RAM
location.
