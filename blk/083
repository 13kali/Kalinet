(cont.) WORDBUF is the buffer used by WORD

BOOT C< PTR is used when Forth boots from in-memory
source. See "Initialization sequence" below.

INTJUMP All RST offsets (well, not *all* at this moment, I
still have to free those slots...) in boot binaries are made to
jump to this address. If you use one of those slots for an
interrupt, write a jump to the appropriate offset in that RAM
location.

CURRENTPTR points to current CURRENT. The Forth CURRENT word
doesn't return RAM+2 directly, but rather the value at this
address. Most of the time, it points to RAM+2, but sometimes,
when maintaining alternative dicts (during cross compilation
for example), it can point elsewhere.                   (cont.)
