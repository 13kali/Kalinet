( Let's do something weird: We'll hold HL by the *tail*.
  Because of our dict structure and because we know our
  lengths, it's easier to compare starting from the end.
  Currently, after CPIR, HL points to char after null. Let's
  adjust. Because the compare loop pre-decrements, instead
  of DECing HL twice, we DEC it once. )
