I/O

A little word about inputs. There are two kind of inputs:
direct and buffered.  As a general rule, we read line in a
buffer, then feed words in it to the interpreter. That's what
"WORD" does. If it's at the End Of Line, it blocks and wait
until another line is entered.

KEY input, however, is direct. Regardless of the input buffer's
state, KEY will return the next typed key.

PARSING AND BOOTSTRAP: Parsing number literal is a very "core"
activity of Forth, and therefore generally seen as having to be
implemented in native code.  However, Collapse OS' Forth
supports many kinds of literals: decimal, hex, char, binary.
This incurs a significant complexity penalty.           (cont.)
