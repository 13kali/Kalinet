Stable ABI

Across all architectures, some offset are referred to by off-
sets that don't change (well, not without some binary manipu-
lation). Here's the complete list of these references:

04 BOOT addr         06 (uflw) addr      08 LATEST
33 2>R wordref       42 EXIT wordref     53 (br) wordref
67 (?br) wordref     80 (loop) wordref   bf (n) wordref
d4 (s) wordref

BOOT and (uflw) exist because they are referred to before those
words are defined (in core words). LATEST is a critical part
of the initialization sequence.
