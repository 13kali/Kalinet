(cont.) In the "/emul" binaries, "HERE" is readjusted to
"CURRENT @" so that we don't have to relocate compiled dicts.
Note that in this context, the initialization code  is fighting
for space with HERE: New entries to the dict will overwrite
that code!  Also, because we're barebone, we can't have
comments. This can lead to peculiar code in this area where we
try to "waste" space in initialization code.
