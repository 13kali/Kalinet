SPI relay driver

This driver is designed for a ad-hoc adapter card that acts as a
SPI relay between the z80 bus and the SPI device. Sending any-  
thing on SPI_CSLOW and SPI_CSHIGH is expected to select/deselect
the device, and writing to SPI_DATA is expected to initiate a   
byte exchange. The result of the exchange is excpected to be re-
trieved by reading SPI_DATA.

Provides (spie) (enable), (spid) (disable), (spix) (xchange).

Load driver with "596 LOAD".
