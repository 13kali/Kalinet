Compilation vs meta-compilation

Compilation vs meta-compilation. When you compile a word with
"[COMPILE] foo", its straightforward: It writes down to HERE
wither the address of the word or a number literal.

When you *meta* compile, it's a bit more mind blowing. It
fetches the address of the word specified by the caller, then
writes that number as a literal, followed by a reference to
",".

Example: ": foo [COMPILE] bar;" is the equivalent of ": foo bar
;" if bar is not an immediate. However, ": foo COMPILE bar ;"
is the equivalent of ": foo ['] bar , ;". Got it?

Meta-compile only works with real words, not number literals.
