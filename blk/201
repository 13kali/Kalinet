The following words allow you to assemble z80 binaries. Being
Forth words, opcode assembly is a bit different than with a
typical assembler. For example, what would traditionally be
"ld a, b" would become "A B LDrr,".

BIN( is the addr at which the compiled binary will live. It is
often 0.

ORG is H@ offset at which we begin spitting binary. Used to
compute PC. To have a proper PC, call  "H@ ORG !" at the
beginning of your assembly process. PC is H@ - ORG + BIN(.
