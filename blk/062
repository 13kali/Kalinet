WORD    -- a   Read one word from buffered input and push its
               addr. Always null terminated. If ASCII EOT is
               encountered, a will point to it (it is cons-
               idered a word).
There are also ascii const emitters:

NL is an indirect word (see B80) that aliases to CRLF by

a newline.
