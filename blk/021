How blocks are organized

Organization of contiguous blocks is an ongoing challenge and
Collapse OS' blocks are never as tidy as they should, but we
try to strive towards a few goals:

1. Block 0 contains documentation discovery core keys to the
   uninitiated.
2. First section (up to B100) is usage documentation.
3. B100-B200 are for runtime usage utilities
4. B200-B500 are for bootstrapping
5. The rest is for recipes.
6. I'm not sure yet how I'll organize multiple arches.
