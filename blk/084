CURRENTPTR points to current CURRENT. The Forth CURRENT word
doesn't return RAM+2 directly, but rather the value at this
address. Most of the time, it points to RAM+2, but sometimes,
when maintaining alternative dicts (during cross compilation
for example), it can point elsewhere.

NLPTR points to an alternative routine for NL (by default,
CRLF).
