CURRENTPTR points to current CURRENT. The Forth CURRENT word
doesn't return RAM+2 directly, but rather the value at this
address. Most of the time, it points to RAM+2, but sometimes,
when maintaining alternative dicts (during cross compilation
for example), it can point elsewhere.

FUTURE USES section is unused for now.          

DRIVERS section is reserved for recipe-specific
drivers. Here is a list of known usages:

* 0x70-0x78: ACIA buffer pointers in RC2014 recipes.
