Branching

Branching in Collapse OS is limited to 8-bit. This represents
64 word references forward or backward. While this might seem
a bit tight at first, having this limit saves us a non-
negligible amount of resource usage.

The reasoning behind this intentional limit is that huge
branches are generally a indicator that a logic ought to be
simplified. So here's one more constraint for you to help you
towards simplicity.
