Drivers

Up until now, we haven't implemented EMIT or KEY yet: those
words are defined in the "high" part of core words because we
generally need machine-specific drivers to implement (emit) and
(key).

Well, now is their time to shine. We split core in two
precisely to fit drivers in there. This way. they have access
to a pretty good vocabulary and they're also give the oppor-
tunity to provide (emit) and (key).
