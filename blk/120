Linker

Relink a dictionary by applying offsets to all word references
in words of the "compiled" type.

A typical usage of this unit would be to, right after a
bootstrap-from-icore-from-source operation, identify the root
word of the source part, probably "H@", and run " ' thatword
RLDICT ". Then, take the resulting relinked binary, concatenate
it to the boot binary, and write to boot media.

LIMITATIONS

This unit can't automatically detect all offsets needing
relinking. This is a list of situations that aren't handled:
