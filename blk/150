Extra words

The Core words (B350) section contains the absolute minimum
needed to get a usable Forth interpreter with input buffer and
disk blocks access running. The goal here is to minimize the
binary size of a minimum Collapse OS install.

Extra words are words you will most likely want because they
are generally useful.

Some programs need them, so they will automatically LOAD them.
Because more than one program can use the same extra words,
conditional loaders are recommended. If you want to load all
words do "152 LOAD" which conditionally loads all extra words.
