Boot words (B305)

Then come the implementation of core Forth words in native
assembly. Performance is not Collapse OS' primary design goal,
so we try to keep this section to a minimum: we much prefer
to implement our words in Forth.

However, some words are in this section for performance
reasons. Sometimes, the gain is too great to pass up.

Core words (low) (B350)

Then comes the part where we begin defining words in Forth.
Core words are designed to be cross-compiled (B260), from a
full Forth interpreter. This means that it has access to more
than boot words. This somes with tricky limitations.    (cont.)
