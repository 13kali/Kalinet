This unit is loaded in two "low" and "high" parts. The low part
is the biggest chunk and has the most definitions. The high
part is the "sensitive" chunk and contains "LITN", ":" and ";"
definitions which, once defined, kind of make any more defs
impossible.

The gap between these 2 parts is the ideal place to put device
driver code. Load the low part with "393 LOAD", the high part
with "415 LOAD"
