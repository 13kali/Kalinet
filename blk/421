5. Core words (high)

Boot code (B280)

This part contains core routines that underpins Forth fundamen-
tal structures: dict navigation and search, PSP/RSP bounds
checks, word types (B85).

It also of course does core initialization: set RSP/PSP, HERE
CURRENT, then call BOOT (see B89).

It also contains what we call the "stable ABI" in its first
0x100 bytes. The beginning og the dict is intertwined in this
layer because EXIT, (br), (?br) and (loop) are part of the
stable ABI.
