( RLATOM pre-comment

  Relink atom at a, applying offset o with limit ol.
  Returns a, appropriately skipped.

  0x24 = IF: 0x24 is an addrWord, which should be offsetted in
  the same way that a regular word would. To achieve this, we
  skip ASKIP and instead of skipping 4 bytes like a numberWord,
  we skip only 2, which means that our number will be treated
  like a regular wordref. )
