# 8086 emulator

This is a work in progress. The goal is to have something lighter than QEMU to
run Collapse OS on and also something that is easier to plug with my stuff.
Something I could run without BIOS (have my own studs for INT 10 and INT 13).

My first try was with 8086tiny, but this code is messy. Fake86 is a bit bigger,
but also cleaner.
