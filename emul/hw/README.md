# Hardware emulation

In this folder, we emulate some of the hardware used in recipes. The emulation
is done in a simplistic manner, just enough to verify that the driver code for
it works generally well. No tricky stuff implemented.

This kind of emulation is useful for detecting obvious regressions without
having to get the code on actual hardware for the upteenth time.

To use, go to the appropriate subfolder and read README there.
