; at28w - Write to AT28 EEPROM
;
; Write data from the active block device into an eeprom device geared as
; regular memory. Implements write polling to know when the next byte can be
; written and verifies that data is written properly.

; Optionally receives a word argument that specifies the number or bytes to
; write. If unspecified, will write until max bytes (0x2000) is reached or EOF
; is reached on the block device.
